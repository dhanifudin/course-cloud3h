#In today's lesson we learned more of the basics about cloud computing especially when it comes to the platform Oracle's OCI(Oracle Cloud Infrastructure). 
In OCI there are 3 categories and 5 services.
Iaas(Infrastructure as a Service), Paas(Platform as a service), Sass(Software as a service) are the categories of OCI.
These are OCI's services 
1. Compute (5 components, namely bare metal, dedicated virtual hosts, virtual machines, container engines, and functions.)
2. Storage (5 storage services supported by OCI, namely block volume, local NVME, file storage, object storage, and archive storage.)
3. Networking (Some of the components contained in the VCN: Subnets, Route Table, Security List, Internet Gateway, Nat Gateway, Service Gateway, Dynamic Router Gateway)
4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
5. Database Cloud Service
#Cloud computing allows developers and companies to focus more on the quality of the product rather than the expandability of the project and the traffic on the server.
#Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a deep and broad platform of public cloud services that enables customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure, highly available, and high-performance environment.
